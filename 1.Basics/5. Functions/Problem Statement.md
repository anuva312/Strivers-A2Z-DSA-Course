# 1. Functions (Pass by Reference and Value)

## Problem

Geek is learning about functions and calling a function with arguments. He learns that passing can take one of two forms: pass by value or pass by reference.

Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to the parameter passed by value and reference. Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input:
a = 1
b = 2
Output:
2 4
Explanation: 1 was passed by value whereas 2 passed by reference.
```

**Example 2 :**

```
Input:
a = 10
b = 20
Output: 11 22
Explanation: 10 was passed by value whereas 20 passed by reference.
```

**Your Task:**
Complete the function passedBy() which takes a and b as input parameters and returns array of two required integers.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1 <= a,b <= 105
