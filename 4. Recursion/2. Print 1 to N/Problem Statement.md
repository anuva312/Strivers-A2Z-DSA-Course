# 2. Print 1 to N

## Problem

Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input:
N = 10

Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

**Your Task:**

Your task is to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively.

**Expected Time Complexity :** O(N)  
**Expected Space Complexity :** O(N) (Recursive)

**Constraints:**  
1<=N<=1000
