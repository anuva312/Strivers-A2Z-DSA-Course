## Problem

Print GFG n times without the loop.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input:
5
Output:
GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
```

**Your Task:**

Your task is to complete the function printGfg() that takes N as parameter and prints N times GFG recursively.

**Expected Time Complexity :** O(N)  
**Expected Space Complexity :** O(N) (Recursive)

**Constraints:**  
1<=N<=1000
