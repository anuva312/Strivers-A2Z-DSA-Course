# 3. Reverse an Array

## Problem

Given an arr arr of size N, return an array with all the elements placed in reverse order.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input:
N=5
arr = [5,7,8,1,6,3]

Output:
[3,6,1,8,7,5]
```

**Your Task:**

Your task is to complete the function sumOfSeries() which takes the integer N as parameter and returns the sum of the cubes of the first N natural numbers.

**Expected Time Complexity :** O(N)  
**Expected Auxilary Space :** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1<=N<=10^6  
-10^9<= arr[i] <=10^9
