# 3. Print N to 1

## Problem

Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.

**Example 1 :**

```
Input:
N = 10

Output:
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

**Your Task:**

Your task is to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from N to 1 recursively.

**Expected Time Complexity :** O(N)  
**Expected Space Complexity :** O(N) (Recursive)

**Constraints:**  
1<=N<=1000
